# Created a fanction that returns the highest product between three of given numbers
* For example, given the list [1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] the highest product would be 10 * 6 * 5 = 300

 #My Solution


**Sorting the Array**:
 I've opted to use the QuickSort algorithm to sort the input array in ascending order. QuickSort is a widely used sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n).

**Finding the Maximum Product**: 
After sorting the array, I can efficiently find the maximum product by simply multiplying the three largest elements. This is possible because the largest three elements are at the end of the sorted array.

 **Demonstrating My Knowledge**: 
This exercise not only solves a practical problem but also showcases my understanding of fundamental algorithmic concepts such as sorting, partitioning, and searching for the maximum value.
